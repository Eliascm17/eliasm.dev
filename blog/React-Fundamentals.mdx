> A first in a series of posts going over my thoughts and reflections of what I learned in the React Fundamentals part of Kent C Dodd's Course: Epic React.

**Note**: I will not be giving anything in particular away as to what is in the course specifically, but I will be going over why this course is benefitting me in what I'm learning.

## From the Ground Up

Kent does a really good job at explaining at the lowest levels how the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) works and how the browser exposes the DOM to allow JavaScript to interact with it. This understanding of how to generate [DOM nodes](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_nodes.asp) using JavaScript seems pointless, but is fundamental to how React works under the hood.

If you've been using React for a while now it will seem that the learning pace may seem a bit slow because you want to just get to the more advanced parts of the course. I found myself in this boat and was quick to be stumped on some of the first exercises because I didn't particularly understand how the DOM worked in its entirety as well as how React uses it under the hood. After the first few exercises I instantly grew a better understanding and appreciation for how React works and allows the developer to do thins with ease when building components.
